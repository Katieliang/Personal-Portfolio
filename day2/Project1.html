As time grew on, our emotions grew more complicated, which is why I painted my plushies because they always have their smiles on their faces, putting it next to a calendar inspires me to cherish my day with happiness. I used mostly warm colors to emphasize this value and I placed my objects on a higher position so light can shine directly on it, creating a positive mood. I also painted the background-bed sheet with, various yellow to depict a warmly energy.
